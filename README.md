# React Context and Hooks Visualizer

The React Context and Hooks Visualizer is a tool that allows users to visualize how data flows and updates in a pseudo-React application environment using React's Context API and Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext). It provides a graphical representation of components, their context relationships, and updates through hooks in real-time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Component Tree**: Users can add, edit, or remove components from a visual tree structure.
- **Context Management**: Allow users to create multiple contexts and visualize their scope across different components.
- **Hooks Simulation**: Simulate the usage of useState and useEffect within these components. Show how states change and effects are called with dependencies.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Reflect changes in the component tree and contexts in real-time as users interact with the simulated environment.
- **Code Generation**: Generate and display the corresponding React code based on the created tree and interactions.
- **Theme Customization**: Let users toggle between different themes (e.g., light mode and dark mode) to change the visual appearance of the visualizer.

## Technical Considerations

- Utilizes advanced React patterns such as higher-order components, custom hooks, and the Context API for state management and component communication.
- Implements a smart layout algorithm to efficiently manage and display the component hierarchy and relationships.
- Uses CSS Grid or Flexbox to handle layout, ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes.
- Incorporates error boundaries to catch and handle exceptions in component trees gracefully.
- Provides a clean, interactive UI with animations to indicate state changes and component interactions smoothly.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jayinmt/context-hooks-visualizer.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd react-context-hooks-visualizer
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the visualizer in action.

## Usage

- Click the "Add Component" button to add a new component to the tree.
- Each component has buttons to increment its count, update the component, or remove it from the tree.
- Toggle the theme between light and dark modes using the "Toggle Theme" button.
- Observe how the component tree updates in real-time as you interact with the components.
